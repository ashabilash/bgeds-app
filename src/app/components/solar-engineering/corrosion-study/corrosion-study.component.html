            <div class="row service-info">
                    Atmospheric corrosion of the steel elements is studied based on governing chemical properties in the air and temperature in line with ISO guidelines. BGEDS perform desk study or site-specific study based on the source data availability. Recommendation on protection derived based on loss rate and design life.

                        Soil corrosion drives to design failure of foundation if it was not looked at true sense. BGEDS has vast experience in design-driven piles in toxic soil in USA and Australia. The process of soil corrosion well covers the region based solution say Raman off /FHWA for US and AS 2041.1 & AS 2159 for Australia.
