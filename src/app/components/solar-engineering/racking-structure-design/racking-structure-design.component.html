                BGEDS Racking Structure Overview
            </div>
            <div class="row service-info">
                BGEDS has vast experiences in developing Preliminary and Detailed design and drawings for racking structure based on AISC
                360-10 in line with ASCE 7-10/7-16 in lines. While dynamic instability is critical for PV racking, team expertise
                in deriving the Design based on Wind tunnel test from RWDI, CPP, etc., BGEDS develops the most appropriate
                design based on DC system requirement and calculation package is stamped with our licensed PE Partners across
                the Globe. The team delivered more than 5 GW PV racking design worldwide for different racking solutions
                such as ground-mount Single-axis 1P /2P, Fixed, Rooftop and Car Port, etc., we use In-house developed sheet
                and FEA platform to develop design and drawings such as RISA, SAP, Soil works and AutoCAD, etc., We also
                delivered project based on EN, AZ, SNI, IS, SBC and other international codes.
